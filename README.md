Open AI clone 
The code imports the OpenAI Python module and sets the API key to authenticate API requests. It then prompts the user to enter a prompt text for the OpenAI GPT-3 language model.The code then calls the openai.Completion.create function to generate text based on the specified prompt. The function takes several arguments, including the name of the GPT-3 model engine to use (text-davinci-002), the prompt text, the maximum number of tokens to generate (max_tokens=1024), and the temperature parameter (temperature=0.9) which controls the randomness of the generated text.The openai.Completion.create function returns a Completion object which contains the generated text. The code extracts the generated text from the Completion object and prints it to the console using the print function.
To brief the code prompts the user for a text prompt, generates text based on the prompt using the OpenAI GPT-3 API, and prints the generated text to the console.
